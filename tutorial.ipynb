        "## Shock Tube Background\n",
        "A shock tube is a tube that has high pressure in one region and low pressure in the other separated by a diaphram such as a rupture disk. The signficance of this problem is that it can be solved analytically which makes it great for testing numerical schemes. It can also be used to test fast response pressure probes and thermocouples. When the diaphragm bursts, there is a sudden expansion wave that accelerates the flow from high pressure to low pressure indicated in region II. The angle of this expansion wave increase over time \\(you will see this later\\). This means the flow is speeding up. There's a also a flat region where nothing is happening - this is the contact discontiunity. In this region Velocity, Pressure, Temperature, and Density are all constant. After the contact discontinuity, there are two shocks to bring the pressure down to the low pressure region.\n",
